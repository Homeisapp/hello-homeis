## Running the project

You can run this project in development mode by running `npm start` or alternatively `yarn start`.
This will run the SCSS pre-processors and watch all files for changes. Changes in JS will refresh the app and changes in SCSS files will hot-reload the app.

In case the script doesn't automatically open the app in a browser just open [this url](http://localhost:3000/)
